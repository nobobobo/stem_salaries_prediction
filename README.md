# stem_salaries_prediction

A linear regression model to predict salaries of STEM workers. 

Source data [Data Science and STEM Salaries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackogozaly/data-science-and-stem-salaries?select=Levels_Fyi_Salary_Data.csv)

## ASK 
This project actually is based on my personal curiosity about the pay of STEM worker from companies, myself as a Data Science major student, and working in one of the FAANG companies. 

Hoping I can know more about the factors that bring higher pay

And I think every STEM specialist has the same motivation to understand the market, and his/her market values. So that they can make better career decisions
